                <h2>Types of Gear Needed</h2>
                <p>When you go on the trails, you will need certain types of gear to ensure your success on your ride. The top 5 pieces of equipment that we suggest you use are listed below.</p>
                <h3>1. Helmet</h3>
                <p>First and foremost, we recomend that you get yourself a helmet. A helmet may not make you look like one of the "cool kids", but at least you can know that your head will be protected from those times that you slip on some uneven terrain and you fall off your bike. And yes, this will happen eventually. It happens to everyone. That is why a helmet is on the top of our list. Helmet use reduces the odds of head injury by 50 percent, and the odds of head, face, or neck injury by 33 percent (stats from helmets.org).</p>
                <h3>2. Tire Pump</h3>
                <p>The pump is one of those crucial pieces of equipment. If you cannot pump up your tires, you cannot ride your bike. There are many different types of tire pumps out there. The best advice in helping you pick the right one for you is to know what type of valve your bike uses to put air into the tire. There are 2 types of valves (Presta valves and Schrader valves). Once you know the type of valve stem your bike tire uses, then you can know which pump to purchase.</p>
                <h3>3. Flat Tire Repair Kit</h3>
                <p>This is a must have in your kit. You will puncture a tire. You would be surprised at how often this can happen too. That is why we highly recommend you have a repair kit with you at all times. We don't want you to get stuck walking back to your transport with a flat tire. Most repair kits involve the same types of equipment in them. There is rubber glue, scratch pad, and a rubber patch. First, you use the scratch pad to roughen up the rubber inner-tube around the puncture. Then you apply a decent amount of glue on around the puncture. Finally, you put the rubber patch on the puncture and put a little bit more glue around the edges of the patch to seal the repair.</p>
                <h3>4. Mountain Biking Gloves</h3>
                <p>While you are riding along the trails, your hands will get put through a lot of bumps and vibrations that will make them pretty sore. These gloves are designed to help absorb these intese vibrations and releave your joints from all that strain. This gear is more for comfort than a necessity, but we still recommend it. Your hands will thank us!</p>
                <h3>5. Hydration Pack</h3>
                <p>In order for you to continuously enjoy your ride and stay out longer is with a hydration pack. Staying hydrated is very important! Not just from mountain biking, but for your daily life aswell. If you are properly hydrated, you will have better temperature control within your body, help your joints from becoming sore, give your more energy, and so much more. If you cannot afford a hydration pack, then we at least advise you to bring along a couple water bottles in your backpack.</p>

                <h2>Types of Wildlife You Will Encounter</h2>
                <p>Utah has a lot of biological diversity throughout the state. We will focusing on the wildlife around
                the Ogden area. cont.</p>
                <h3>Dangerous Animals</h3>
                <p>In Northern Utah, there are not very many dangerous animals. But there are a few that you really should look out for.</p>
                <h4>Mountain Lions/Cougars</h4>
                <p>Be very careful if you come across a mountain lion. They are just like any other large cat in physique. Mountain lions are a dusty color and can blend into the rocks and cliffsides very well. If you encounter one, try to make yourself look large by waving your hands above your head and start making loud noises to try and scare them off.</p>
                <h4>Rattlesnakes</h4>
                <p>If you start hearing a rattling sound, stop where you are, don't move, and start looking at and around your feet to try and find where the sound is coming from. Once you find where the snake is hiding, step back away from it slowly and give it space. Rattlesnakes are very venomous, so getting bit is not going to be a good thing for you. If you do happen to get bit, then you should call 9-1-1. You will be needing anti-venom to help stop the venom from doing any major harm to your body.</p>
                <h3>Harmless Animals</h3>
                <h4>Deer</h4>
                <p>These animals will most likely run away from you if you are too loud or get too close. They will not harm you at all. But if you want to stop to admire them, then make sure you stay quite and move slowly to allow yourself to get a better view to take photos.</p>
                <h4>Skunks</h4>
                <p>Easily identified by white stripes down the black body, these little fellows will spray you with a very potent, unplesant smelling liquid. It is very hard to get out and wash off, so we recommend to give these animals their space and try not to spook them or cause them to defend themselves.</p>
                <h3>Remember that you are in the animal's habitat and so you should leave them the space they need and deserve. But you are more than welcome to admire nature as long as you obey its rules.</h3>
