            Main Idea for Site
        </h3>
        <p>
            I want this website to be a place where people can go to get detailed information about gear to use, places
            to go, and where to buy your gear locally here in Ogden, UT. The reason I had this idea is because I feel
            there aren't a lot of places where you can go to get all the information you need in one location. Usually,
            you have to visit multiple sources or videos in order to get what you are looking for. And if I could help
            create a place where this is all readily available for viewers, that would help fix that issue.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Home Page Content Pt 1.
        </h3>
        <p>
            On this main home page, I was thinking about having three boxes under the hero image to also be used as
            links for the nav links. One of those links will take you to the "About Us" page. The middle one will take
            you to the "What to Expect" page where we will dive in to what you should know about mountain biking before
            you start riding for yourself. In that "What to Expect" box as well, you will find a bunch of info of what
            local wildlife is present that you need to be wary of while riding the trails. We want to help people have
            an idea of what the wildlife looks like and what to do to avoid those creatures. And then the last box will
            be for the "Events" page. This is pretty self-explanatory. It is used to show upcoming dates for things we
            are hosting or what other people are hosting locally in the Ogden, UT area.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Home Page Content Pt 2.
        </h3>
        <p>
            Near the bottom of the home page, we will have two images and two word boxes where we will link the most
            recent article in the top box where it will talk about mountain biking or extreme weather for the local
            region. The bottom box will have text talking about the pros and cons to buying cheaper gear or buying more
            expensive gear. And that text box will have links to the local bike shops where you can browse their
            catalogs and get the gear you are looking for.
        </p>

        <h3>
            About Us
        </h3>
        <p>
            In the "About Us" section, we will go over why we are building this site for people. We will talk about how
            you need to go through many hoops to find what you are looking for with other sources. We just want to
            create a platform where it is a one-stop-shop for all your information.
