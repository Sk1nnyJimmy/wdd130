    <h2>Robert Hadley</h2>

    <p>Hello everyone, I still am not 100% sure what I want to do with my career. All I know is that I want to go into computer science. I have looked into doing IT/Tech Support. All I know is that I want to use some form of coding. I enjoy coding from the little experience I have had with it so far.</p>
    <p>I have quite a few hobbies that I do regularly. My top hobby is playing Call of Duty. I am the owner and manager of a Discord server for Call of Duty and love doing that. Another one of my hobbies is watching and enjoying anything Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, or Jurassic Park related. I have been in love with those 3 franchises since I was a little kid.</p>
    <p>I am married and have been for almost 4 years now. We don't have any children quite yet, but we do have 2 dogs. Kakashi is our oldest dog, he will be 2 years old in December. And our youngest dog is named Ahsoka. She is only 3 months old right now so she is still a little puppy. We love our dogs though.</p>
    <p>I am excited to learn more about how to code and build a well functioning website from this course.</p>
